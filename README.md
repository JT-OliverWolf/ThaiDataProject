# ThaiDataProject
This project is part of Statistics for Computer Engineering Applications at Kasetsart University.

It consists of a clustering part, where I apply the KMeans clustering algorithm to the data and try to group the provinces that have the same characteristic together.

Another part is a logistic regression, where we are trying to predict from the data if the country is considered a developed country or not.
